This Project is an API ( JSON Application ) for editing images using python ( pillow library ) and flask .

The main goal in this project is to learn about flask basics and how its used to build APIs and Practice using pillow in python.

Also one of the important things is how to deal with online storages ( amazon -> AWS -> S3 ) and upload pictures online then retrieve them from the server. 

-Upload the image to s3 ( using the route "/images" ) via "POST" and you can see the image via "GET" 

-Download file : '/downloads/<name>/' you can download the file from the server

-The actions the user can do : 
Resize image with custom sizes,
resize preset ({'small' : (640, 480), 'medium' : (1280, 720), 'large' : (1920,1080)} ),
rotate image,
and flip image 


-filters : blur, contrast, brightness of the image

-android.py file : we have various dimensions[29, 40, 57, 58, 60, 80, 87, 114, 120, 180, 1024], for each dimension the app will create picture for it 1:1 ratio 

- Finally we have a file (helpers.py) which have functions that help the application to work for example:

	- is_allowed_extension : to filter the allowed extensions (ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = ['png', 'jpg', 'jepg'] ) to avoid errors 

	- get_secure_filename_filepath : returns the tuple (filename_secure , filepath ) that will be used later	

	- upload_to_s3:  takes the file and the bucket name and save it inside that bucket in S3 service 
	
	- and finally download_from_s3 : takes file name and download it from S3 and return it

This project implements a lightweight, JSON-based image-editing API built with Flask and Python’s Pillow library. It demonstrates how to upload and manage images in AWS S3—handling secure filenames, extension checks, and S3 uploads/downloads—and provides a suite of editing operations (custom and preset resizing, rotation, flipping) as well as filters for blur, contrast, and brightness. Additionally, it includes an Android helper that generates square assets at multiple resolutions and a collection of utility functions (in helpers.py) to streamline file handling and image processing.
